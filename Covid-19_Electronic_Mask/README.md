# COVID'19 Electronic Gesture Controlled Mask
This is a COVID'19 Mask which can be controlled by hand gestures.This mask can recognize two kinds of gestures which are 
"UP" and "DOWN". UP gesture is used for covering up the face (making mask move up) and DOWN gesture is used to expose the 
face (making the mask go down).

## Hardware Used
1. Arduino Pro Mini
2. Ice Cream Sticks.
3. Gesture Sensor
4. Two Servo Motors
5. Dumy spectacles as chassis(You can use your own custom chassis if you want)

## Software Used
Only one software which is Arduino IDE is used in this project. If you want you can use additional softwares to expand
the capability of this project. New ideas are always welcomed:)
