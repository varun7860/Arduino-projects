# Arduino-projects
This repository consists of various interesting  Arduino projects made by me so far with the explanation. Before starting to do the projects I varun walimbe welcome you to my repository of arduino projects :). The most important thing about building the project is having knowledge about the components or controller that is used in the project.This readme file will get you started with this.

What is Arduino?
>>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.
