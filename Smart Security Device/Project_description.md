# Smart Security Device

## Description
- Citizens are already grappling with many urban challenges on a regular basis. Rapid urbanization is bringing along more challenges, including cities becoming more vulnerable to crime. Safety and security was a key issue raised in the Citizen Engagement survey. Crimes such as rape, theft, sexual assault is becoming very common in india nowadays.
